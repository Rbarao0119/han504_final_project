## Reflection
The solution's overall structure and the way the many Azure services work together to create a simple, modular workflow are what give me the most confidence. We used the storage → serverless compute → database → dashboard pattern a lot this semester, so it felt extremely natural to apply it to the pharmacy use case. Additionally, I have faith in the reasoning behind importing daily dispense CSV files, computing fundamental adherence measures like refill gaps, and presenting that data via a dashboard that techs and pharmacists can actually utilize. Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and Azure SQL have distinct architectural boundaries, and I am at ease discussing the rationale behind each service's suitability as well as how they work together.Large-scale performance optimization also gives me less confidence, particularly when it comes to Azure SQL indexing techniques, secure networking (private endpoints, VNets), and more complex dashboard routines. I am aware of the concepts in these areas, but I haven't had to put them into practice on a large scale.

Building the application on GCP rather than Azure and utilizing Cloud Run for the dashboard, Cloud Functions for ingestion, and BigQuery or Cloud SQL for storage was one alternative architecture I thought about. Although this would have been an useful serverless solution, Azure fit the pharmacy situation and the examples we worked on earlier in the semester better, so I decided against it. Although OCI's serverless and analytics toolset is less practical for this kind of iterative approach, I also thought about developing the solution on OCI, where the MySQL Database Service is highly powerful.

I would enhance the system by investigating multi-cloud versions and developing the identical pipeline once in GCP and once in OCI to evaluate performance, operational complexity, and cost if I had an additional four to eight weeks and limitless credits. Additionally, I would enhance the adherence logic's intelligence by possibly experimenting with Azure ML or GCP Vertex AI notebooks to develop basic prediction models for identifying high-risk patients.
